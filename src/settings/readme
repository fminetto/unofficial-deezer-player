HOW TO ADD CUSTOM SETTINGS:

1. Add html to settings.html, it's preferable to match id with the variable
2. Add settings.js's defaults variable
3. Edit settings-deezer.js don't forget initialization and binding the event properly
4. Add whatever logic you like :) just see settings.js's methods set_attribute and get_attribute
